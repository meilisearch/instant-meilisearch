# MeiliSearch Simple Game Search

This repository is a **playground**, all the following files are hot-reloading:
- _ROOT_/src/*
- _ROOT_/template/basic_search.css
- ./public/index.html

meaning you can change the code of this demo but also `instant-meilisearch` and it will hot reload (if you run it with `yarn serve`).

The main purpose of this example is to showcase that instant-meilisearch can be easely included in an existing front-end application using `<script>` tags.

The demo in this directory showcases a basic search that will let you search through games names.
